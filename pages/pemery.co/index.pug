  h2 About Me 
  | I've been a career software engineer for over 5 years, and have worked professionally in development  
  | for nearly 10. 
  | I specialize in continuous integration and deployment, technical communication, and heuristic analysis.
  br
  br
  | In my time in-field I've worked with a number of languages and technologies, though I am generally 
  | most familiar with Rust, C++, and Python for systems development, Python and JavaScript for serverless and 
  | distributed deployment, and Svelte, Vue, and React for front-end web development.
  | I have worked in a more limited capacity with C#, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Perl, and a number of smaller or domain-specific 
  | languages and technologies.
  h2 About This Site 
  | This site is a derivative of a personal project and portfolio piece of mine.
  | It is a static site generated using Node + Pug and deployed automatically to AWS via S3, 
  | where it is routed through CloudFront.
