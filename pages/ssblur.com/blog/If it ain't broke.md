Fix it twice.

I made this blog section a while back, and in my mind I was thinking "oh man I already use LibreOffice Writer for writing, what if I designed the blog to use a compatible format", not really thinking too much about it. If you care about the specifics, I made [a blog post](/blog/Blogging.html) about it already.

Well, it turns out, that wasn't a great idea.
Because of course it wasn't.

## The Problems

So, literally the first post I made created enough friction to scare me off using the blog. 
I had to strip RTF control codes to get stuff working, links and images weren't supported at all, and the whole thing was just kinda clunky.

And because of that, I didn't use the blog section really at all after making it.

## The Solution

I was thinking too much.
You know what has great editors, is easily converted to a webpage, and was designed to support at least links right out of the box?

What? HTML? Why would I write a website in that?

Markdown!

Just install Ghostwriter, rewrite the first post, swap converters over to [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), and we're off.

## The Goal

Write more blog posts now, I guess? 
I've been working on one detailing some challenges and accompanying solutions with Tiny Life mod development, so hopefully I can get that off the ground at some point.

Either way, we're in a new age of Markdown-driven blogging.
May it be prosperous.
