        | Q: What do you do?
        ul
          li
            | In my day job, I work as a software engineer on DevOps and testing tools for a bank.
            br
            | Here, I play video games, create mods for games, build bots, and sketch Slowpokes.
            | I&apos;d recommend checking out my YouTube if you&apos;re looking for some examples.
      li
        | Q: Who edits your videos?
        ul
          li
            | Most of my highlight videos are edited by the team at 
            a(href='https://danos.works') danos.works
            | , but occasionally I&apos;ll edit one. 
            br
            | I have edited all my project videos (so far!). 
            br
            | If you are interested in editing for the channel, send pricing info to 
            a(href='mailto:info@ssblur.com') info@ssblur.com
            | , along with a portfolio if you&apos;d like.

        | Q: When do you stream?
        ul
          li
            | I keep my stream schedule updated on my 
            a(href='https://www.twitch.tv/ssblur' title='Twitch')
              +icon('message-typing')
              | Twitch
            | , though sometimes I will delay stream by an hour or two, since my job occasionally gets in the way. 
            br
            | Additionally, sometimes I&apos;ll do additional bonus streams. When I do these, I&apos;ll announce them on my 
            a(href='https://discord.gg/Uwbtmmb' title='Discord')
              +icon('social-discord')

      li
        | Q: Can I get my name in your videos?
        ul
          li
            | Since I am generally supported well enough by sponsors, I don&apos;t have a Patreon and don&apos;t usually encourage subscriptions. 
            br
            | I generally do thank and interact with regular viewers / commenters, though, so feel free to drop by my streams on 
            a(href='https://www.twitch.tv/ssblur' title='Twitch')
              +icon('message-typing')
              | Twitch
            | or leave a comment on a video on 
            a(href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC87-8FM-U9OSUYCzIqlhztA' title='YouTube')

      li
        | Q: What does the name mean?
        ul
          li
            | SSBlur is short for &quot;Super Sonic Blur&quot;, originally stylized as SUPERSonicBlur.
            br
            | It doesn&apos;t really mean anything, I stole it from a kid when I was in elementary school.
            | He played Webkinz and their name was &quot;SonicBlur67&quot; I think.
            br
            | He then suggested I should pick up Webkinz, so I did.
            | But I had a problem: I had no idea how to pick a username.
            br
            | Well, I wanted something better than &quot;SonicBlur&quot;.
            br
            | So I picked &quot;SUPERSonicBlur&quot;.
            br
      li
        | Q: Why is your name not always the same?
        ul
          li
            | Typically it's just "blur", but sometimes people already know me as something else,
            | there's already another blur, or the username is taken. In these cases, I'll use 
            | the older "SSBlur" or some variation like "bIur"/"biur", "blub", or something similar.
