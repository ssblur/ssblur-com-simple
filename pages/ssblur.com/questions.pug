        | Q: What does the name mean?
        ul
          li
            | SSBlur is short for &quot;Super Sonic Blur&quot;, originally stylized as SUPERSonicBlur.
            br
            | It doesn&apos;t really mean anything, I stole it from a kid when I was in elementary school.
            | He played Webkinz and their name was &quot;SonicBlur67&quot; I think.
            br
            | He then suggested I should pick up Webkinz, so I did.
            | But I had a problem: I had no idea how to pick a username.
            br
            | Well, I wanted something better than &quot;SonicBlur&quot;.
            br
            | So I picked &quot;SUPERSonicBlur&quot;.

        | Q: Why is your name not always the same?
        ul
          li
            | Typically it's just "blur", but sometimes people already know me as something else,
            | there's already another blur, or the username is taken. In these cases, I'll use 
            | the older "SSBlur" or some variation like "bIur"/"biur", "blub", or something similar.
